# Interactive Website

This is an interactive website that guides users through a series of prompts and choices.

## About

The website starts by asking the user to enter their name. It then asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 10. If the number is valid, it then gives the user the choice to continue with additional activities.

If the user chooses to continue, they're asked which city they would like to visit next from three options: London, Paris, and New York. Depending on the city chosen, an image of the city is displayed.

The user can choose to finish the process at any time, which takes them back to the start.
